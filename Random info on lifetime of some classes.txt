Some classes will have a static ref to itself when it is first created. 
These are single lifetime object that should only have one instance for the life
of the session. Most of the Handler are session long objects and could be autoloaded
but the use of a static var that ref itself is works as well.

List of session long objects:
	Game_Handler
	(NOTE: below are not nesssary since game handler would know about them
	so it might be better to autoload game_handler if able to autoload scenes)
	World_Handler
	(maybe)Player_Handler (need to test networking and see what is best)
	HUD
	(probably all handlers, but currently unsure)
